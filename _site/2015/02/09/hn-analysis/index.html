  <h1 class="post-title">An Data-Based Analysis of Hacker News</h1>
  <time datetime="2015-02-09T00:00:00-06:00" class="page-date">09 Feb 2015</time>
  <p>Or: 2048 Con, asking Edward.</p>

<p>After spending a little too much time reading Hacker News, I decided to take a more systematic look at what ends up on HN and what does well. This analysis inspired the alternate title – read on to find out more.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> is a website about a wide-range of subjects – everything from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9015092">philosophy</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8940723">design</a> to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8980047">job postings</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9018247">programming languages</a>. Hacker News, or as my classmates called it “that hacker website”, is frequently compared to <a href="http://reddit.com">reddit</a>. A similar <a href="http://www.randalolson.com/2013/03/15/a-data-driven-guide-to-creating-successful-reddit-posts/">analysis</a> of reddit was pretty interesting, so I wanted to explore how Hacker News would compare (albeit with a more exploratory approach).</p>

<p>Of note: I did this entirely for fun; don’t take it too seriously.</p>

<h2 id="when-are-posts-written">When are posts written?</h2>

<p>More items are posted on weekdays, generally around midday (EST). This is consistent with my expectations – that most people who post on Hacker News are doing so from the US and Europe. 
<img src="/assets/posts.png" alt="Plot of posts by day" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, if we overlay each day on the same scale, we can see that posts occur later on weekends and continue into the night. I.e., I’m not the only one who’s wasted a Saturday night on Hacker News!
<img src="/assets/posts_hour.png" alt="Plot of posts by time" /></p>

<p>In terms of popularity of posts, there’s little relationship between time of day and popularity.
<img src="/assets/points.png" alt="Plot of average points vs time" /></p>

<p>You may have noticed that there is a relationship between day of week and popularity of the posts. This relationship is statistically signifiant (using a non-parametric <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann-Whitney U Test</a>) and I think more clear using boxplots.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/points_day.png" alt="Plot of points by day" /></p>

<h2 id="what-is-posted">What is posted?</h2>
<p>One of the most interesting things to me about Hacker News is the diversity of posts. Below is a plot that shows how frequently a post comes from any site in each month. A couple slight caveats though: I only included sites that accounted for ≥2% of the posts in a month (everything else is in the ‘Other’ category), and I foolishly included ‘co.uk’ as it’s own site. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/diversity.png" alt="Plot of sources" /></p>

<p>It is pretty clear that while there is a tech focus (techcrunch, ycombinator, wired, etc), no single site accounts for more than a tiny portion of the posts. I repeated this analysis for high scoring posts (&gt; 100 points) and found essentially the same result. For comparison, roughly 60% of posts on reddit link to imgur. </p>

<p>I did a similar analysis of the users who submitted posts and high-scoring posts and again found very limited concentration.</p>

<p>Now, on to topics. To begin, I wanted to see whether it was possible to categorize topics based only on their title. Of course, I first made a wordcloud of the titles (very important step in the scientific process).
<img src="/assets/wordcloud_all.png" alt="Wordcloud of titles" /></p>

<p>I found that, using a k-means clustering algorithm (an unsupervised learning technique) on the overlapping words, I was able to create categories that seemed pretty meaningful. However, I found that these categories were not robust; i.e., when I reran the clustering algorithm I’d get new categories. The few that were fairly consistent were: Show/Ask HN, Google, and Windows/Microsoft. A few of the categories shown below are pretty interesting: </p>

<ul>
  <li>The ‘attack’ category includes both ‘nuclear’ and ‘ddos’. </li>
  <li>The ‘color’ category includes both ‘blind’ and ‘palette’</li>
  <li>The ‘day’ category includes ‘zero’ and ‘demo’</li>
  <li>There’s an entire category for ‘love tablet’. It is best not to examine this too much.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/wordcloud_25.png" alt="Wordcloud of categories" /></p>

<p>This shouldn’t be too surprising. Working with very short ‘documents’ means that coincident single words will define entire categories. This technique works better when you can compare longer documents. </p>

<p>More seriously, in the future I’d like to see whether I can find a better way to categorize the posts, likely using the content on page they link to (difficult) or comments on HN (more doable).</p>

<p>I then wanted to see whether any words were strong predictors of high/low scores. To do so, I ran linear regressions on the number of points for each post, and the presence of each word in that post. For example, I would look for a correlation between the number of uses of the word ‘google’ in a title and the points that post scored. Because the number of uses in the word is generally binary (either 0 or 1), this is roughly the same as asking “is the average score higher for titles using this word than for titles not using this word?”</p>

<p><img src="/assets/word_scatterplot.png" alt="Scatterplot of words vs score" /></p>

<p>I then filtered these out to exclude uncommon words and words with an insignificant impact on the total point scored and found the following.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/significant_words.png" alt="Expected increase in score by word" /></p>

<p>So using words like ‘iphone’ and ‘hn’ are correlated to lower scores, but words like ‘2048’ and ‘broke’ correspond to higher point totals. Apparently using ‘hn’ <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7988216">three times</a> in <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8561849">one title</a> didn’t help improve scores (or maybe these posts were just a little too meta).</p>

<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding thoughts</h2>
<p>While none of the findings here are all that important, I think they are rather interesting. Especially the last few items: the (in)ability to classify only using the title and the relative importance of some titles over others.</p>

<p>More broadly, lots of these same tactics can be useful for more serious work, and it’s nice to have a data set on which to practice.</p>
