1. Randomly find a purchasable book on amazon with 0 reviews
2. how to do a linear model correctly (?)
4. Expand on the hacker news idea -- actually load the comments and start to categorize the posts (maybe restrict to high ranking posts)
5. Some better visualizations of Kayak mytrips data. So much there. 
6. Search for hotel rooms that are cheaper w/ 2 people than 1
7. song compositions using empirical markov chains? That's probably pretty difficult, but what if I look for ngrams rather than individual notes? It'd then be pretty derivative (maybe?).
