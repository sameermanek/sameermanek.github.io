Once again, I'm a student. This time at [Harvard Business School](http://www.hbs.edu/), last time studying biomedical engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](http://jhu.edu). I'm interested in data science, investing, design, books, and really just about everything else.

I made this site using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) to occasionally record my ideas, rants, and observations. It, ideally, will also force me to follow through with various side projects.

If you want to contact me, my email is [firstname].[lastname] at gmail.
